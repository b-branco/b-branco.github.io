I’m a PhD student investigating the use of machine learning to address depression heterogeneity across the life course, under the supervision of [Prof Heather Whalley](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/persons/heather-whalley), [Dr Alex Kwong](https://edwebprofiles.ed.ac.uk/profile/dr-alex-kwong), and [Prof Peggy Series](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/pseries/).

I have a background in engineering, with a BEng degree in Electronics Engineering from Durham University and an MSc in Human and Biological Robotics from Imperial College London. For my Master’s thesis, I developed a phone app to monitor and support children and young people’s mental health during the COVID-19 lockdowns.

Between my MSc and PhD, I worked in technical communications for software products, first as a Technical Writer at Microsoft, then as a Documentation Engineer at Imagination Technologies.
